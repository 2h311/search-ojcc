hello hello. this is a bedside project

This is an Adjuster Data Pull Bot to access https://www.jcc.state.fl.us
I choose not to work on page 2 of the requirements.


## Phase 1
I don't think I need to work on Phase 1 since I'm exposing the link to the pdf. The user can easily download the pdf file using that link.

The fields extracted from Pdfs are:
OJCC#
Adjuster Name
Telephone
Email Address
Lost Time Case
Medical Benefits Case


## Phase 2
Work on UI to interface with an API connected to ojcc.py
